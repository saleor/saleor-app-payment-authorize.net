 * What you can see below is a classic example of a hack.
 *
 * We need to pass the saleorTransactionId to Authorize.net transaction so that we can
 * later (in the Authorize â†’ Saleor webhook) match the Authorize.net transaction with the Saleor transaction.
 *
 * The logical way to do it would be by using the `refId` field, but it's limited to 20 characters. Saleor transaction id is longer than that.
 * Thus, why we use the `order.description` field, which is limited to 255 characters.
 *
 * `transactionIdConverter` makes sure the format of the string is the same on both sides.
